## LNSIM Dataset
LNSIM dataset is a large-scale outdoor natural scene image memorability database, containing 2,632 outdoor natural scene images with their ground truth memorability scores. All images are voted by several participants and the memorability scores of these images are obtained by the memory game mentioned in the paper. Moreover, hrs.mat includes the ground-truth memorability score corresponding to each image.

## How to use

Image_data: outdoor natural scene images.

Random_splits: the ground-truth memorability scores of natural scene images in our database. Since we intend to train and test models on the memorability scores rated by different subjects, we split the memorability scores of all subjects into two groups and calculate the average scores of each group. We randomly split the scores for 25 times. In each split, the average score of the first and second groups are in "subject_hrs1.mat" and "subject_hrs2.mat", respectively.

## Corresponding code
[The test Code](https://github.com/RenYang-home/Natural-Scene-Memorability) of the proposed approach is publicly released.
